# Before Pregnancy Preparation 

## Adjusting the pump settings
Currently, I am using an insulin pump and CGM (670G with the Guardian sensor 3 from Medtronic), so if you take multiple daily shots, my advice may not to be relevant to you. The first step toward planning a successful pregnancy is to get your sugar under control and hit the appropriate targets. My HbA1c was always fluctuating. In fact, my diagnosis a month before I decided I wanted to have kids was uncontrolled type 1 diabetes with an HbA1c value of 7.7%.

According to the American Diabetes Association (ADA) [^1], targets for optimal glucose control are:

-	Fasting glucose: < 95 mg/dL 
-	1-hour postprandial glucose: < 140 mg/dL
-	2-hour postprandial glucose: < 120 mg/dL 
- HbA1c: < 6%

To achieve these targets, many topics need to be addressed, but the most important one is exporting and analyzing your CGM data. When doing this, you can see your specific trends, and you can start working on them. To analyze my patterns, I used two tools, the Medtronic CareLink and Tidepool. This last one, Tidepool, was the one I liked the most since I could visualize better the data on a daily, weekly, and monthly basis.  

My glucose levels in January, before even thinking about having a baby, had a very clear pattern: I was high pretty much the whole day. I only manage to be on target 27% of the time. Out of the 24 hours of the day that means I was on target for about 6 hours a day. These 6 hours “on target” were during the night, and they were not really on target; I was running on the 130s which is not really our target when fasting glucose should be less than 96 mg/dL. Additionally, my average glucose was 182 mg/dL with a standard deviation of 56 mg/dL. Another point to consider is that I was using Auto Mode 100% of the time. The 670G insulin pump target for Auto Mode is 120 mg/dL which is not ideal if you want to have tighter control. Let me show you my data for that month which I exported using Tidepool.

This graph shows how off I was from the desirable targets, and how the estimated HbA1c was 7.7% which was accurate. My last HbA1c was back in November 2019, and it was exactly 7.7%. Having a visualization of my numbers made me realized how bad I was doing in the past few months. In my opinion, this is the first step towards lowering your HbA1c, awareness.
