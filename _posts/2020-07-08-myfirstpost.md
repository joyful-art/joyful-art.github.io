# Hello!

You are probably wondering who am I; right? My name is Amy, and I have been type 1 diabetic for 10 years. Wow… 10 years, that is a long time. Six months ago, I would have considered myself an expert regarding type 1 diabetes treatments. I do not know if this happens to you too, but at the endocrinologist’s office I would be thinking “I know what he is about to tell me… I need better diet, better carb counting skills, more exercise”. However, when your blood sugar gets promoted to the top of your priority list instead of been always in the back of your mind is when you truly master control and realize all the things you were doing wrong. In my case, this promotion took ten years (I hope this is not your case), because I am ready to start a family now. We have heard that pregnancy and type one diabetes is hard, but with the right tools at your disposition, you can do it. This blog is my experience through my first pregnancy.
